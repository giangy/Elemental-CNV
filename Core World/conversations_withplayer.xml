    <Text>[L_LeaderName], I have seen the brutality of the Empires. The question I ask is this: Is the savagry of the Empires the result of the inherent evil ways of the Fallen or because of a flawed ideology?</Text>
    <Text>[L_LeaderName], the Empires will never succeed. When the Titans fell, so too went the only reason for any Empire to exist. The future belongs to the Kingdoms.</Text>
    <Text>[L_LeaderName]. I have been to  your capital, [L_CAPITAL_CITY]. It is fast growing but do not mistake it as being an avatar to be emulated. The Empires will never again rule this world.</Text>

		<Text>Let me tell you something that few know the whole truth of, [L_LeaderName]. The Dread Lord Talax himself, the very last of the Titans, favored me with his wisdom concerning the inevitable battle between the Kingdoms and the Empires. It is the destiny of the Empires to rule. We are the true inheritors of Curgen's throne and our armies will fulfill his vision.</Text>
		<Text>I shall share with you tidings, [L_LeaderName]. The people of [L_CAPITAL_CITY] are unaware of the nature of the struggle between the Kingdoms and the Empires. The Kingdoms do not understand the nature of life. It is short. It is harsh. It is a struggle. The world is governed by the laws of scarcity. The Empires understand this and will do whatever is necessary to secure their existence. The Kingdoms, by contrast, will not.</Text>
		<Text>Let me tell you the true nature of the Kingdoms, [L_LeaderName]. In all things, they are weak. When boldness is required, they vacillate. When action necessary, they deliberate. When words are superflous, they pontificate. It is for these reasons that they shall fail to survive in this world of scarcity.</Text>
		<Text>The rise of the Empires is ineviable, [L_LeaderName]. These are desperate times. And we are a desperate people. We provide the example. We do not stray our course to aid those less fortunate.
