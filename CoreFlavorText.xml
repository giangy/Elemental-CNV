      Gouged from the black obsidian of N'it'Vaganesh by the Titan Curgen, guarded by a great iron gate, the Pit of Lost Voices is haunted by the damned and the dying. Here were sacrificed thousands of the Titan's creations: those who fell short of perfection in his sight, those who angered him, and those who lost favor for some trivial offense. Stand near enough to the gate, and their voices can be heard still, some say. Though others believe those voices belong to Curgen's demons - drednii of dark power, drawn to the suffering within the Pit, and trapped there when the Cataclysm sealed the iron gates shut.

A formidable barrier to your progress - but what lurks inside is more formidable still. This is the dwelling place of Abeix - one of the Elemental Lords of old. In the days before the coming of men and the Titans, his kind ruled this world. Now his domain is shrunk to encompass only the chasm before you.

For a moment, your heart aches for this fallen god, and his plight. Yet you know if you can defeat Abeix and his creatures, this territory will be yours.</Text>

    <Text>Your throat is parched - the stench of sweat and smoke is all around. You cough, take a long drink of water and survey the land before you. It is rock, and lava, and fire. Pockets of flame erupt from the ground everywhere you look, and no wonder: these are the Burning Lands, the territory of Delin - the Elemental Lord of Fire. It is the territory of his creatures as well - the Ignys, the fire snakes who guard his sanctum, and that of the lesser elementals he commands.

If you seek to restore life to these regions, you will have to fight - and defeat - all of them.

In the time before this one, the Imperia were the Titan Curgen's bases - outposts of his empire, scattered throughout the land. You are instantly on guard, for the descendants of the dark creatures Curgen deemed worthy to be his sentinels may yet roam the ruins visible beyond the gate. Yet if you can conquer those survivors, and build a city of your own here, the rewards will be great indeed</Text>

And yet... if the sick and diseased were pruned from this land, if the marsh drained, and the grass allowed to grow... the Asag could once more be fertile, productive land...</Text>

The tattered banners of kingdoms long since vanished - Antheros and Vazghur, Redstone and Imperium - still flutter in the breeze, in the grip of skeletons whose flesh and clothing have rotted away. But metal remains; armor glittering in the sunset, longswords and halberds, battleaxes and daggers scattered on the ground. In the distance, smoke rises from a campfire. Someone has taken up residence here; if you want to claim any of the scraps here as your own, you'll have to fight for them.</Text>

Once, long ago, the primal forces of nature - those worshipped as the Five, the Elemental Lords of this planet - moved proudly among their creations. Now the cities have fallen. The land has died. All that remains is rot and ruin.

Now this is the Bilge. All manner of dangerous creatures roam here. But if you can clear the ruins of them, you may be able to civilize - and settle - this land once more...

These devastated lands - these twisted rocks, these awe-inspiring craters - mark the boundaries of that battlefield.

		<Text>A turbulent life had sharpened [SovereignName]. Orphaned at an early age when [GenderHisHer] clan's humble camp was set ablaze by wandering thieves, the young [GenderBoyGirl] learned quickly the hard rules of existence. Finding a new home under the watchful eye of a caring scholar, [SovereignName] poured [GenderHisHer] attention into the books that surrounded [GenderHimHer]. Tales of legendary battles sent [GenderHisHer] mind racing between dreams of heroism and the harsh reality of the sword. Revenge tormented [GenderHisHer] slumber, and slowly eroded [GenderHisHer] youthful spirit into something hard and battle ready. [SovereignName] now seeks to protect those in need and restore balance to a world plunging into darkness.</Text>

Friends who caused [SovereignName] sadness would fall upon the poorest of luck, and dreams of a glorious kingdom with [SovereignName] overlooking it seemed more real than life in [GenderHisHer] village. Now [SovereignName] has grown, and looks to find if there is any truth to those dreams.</Text>

But this safety would prove fleeting, for it took but one solitary night of horror to destroy that facade of sanctuary. Family and friends were slaughtered in an act of villainous mutiny; the small nation was brought to ruin. Luckily, [SovereignName] was led by a handful of servants outside the castle's walls, and as the palace [GenderHeShe] once despised was engulfed in flame, [SovereignName] made a silent oath to rebuild it.</Text>

With no family, home, or drive to adventure, the humble miner spent long days digging downwards and restful nights under the sky gazing upwards. One morning, as the stirred dust hung heavy in the small tunnel, [SovereignName] uncovered a relic of the Cataclysm. Accidentally touching this innocuous crystal, visions pierced [GenderHisHer] mind of dusty wastes brought to life by [GenderHisHer] touch. From that day [SovereignName] worked to discover [GenderHimHer]self and the great powers beheld in that vision.</Text>

    <Topic>GameplayTips_General</Topic>
    
    <!-- RESOURCES -->
    <Text>Be careful when raising your tax rate, as it increases the Unrest in your cities.  Unrest reduces the amount of production and research your cities generate.</Text>
    <Text>Be mindful of where you build your cities.  The amount of Grain available to a city impacts how much food that city can produce, and therefore how large it can grow.  Likewise Materials impact a city's production, making cities with a lot of Materials (4-5) great for building expensive improvements or advanced troops, which will take longer in cities with 2 or 3 Materials.</Text>
    <Text>Resources gathered outside city walls become prime targets to your enemies and wandering creatures. Guard them with soldiers to keep them from being destroyed and losing the resources they provide.</Text>
    <Text>Make sure to build improvements on the wild resources near your cities to reap their benefits.</Text>
    <Text>Building a shard shrine on a shard you control will increase the power of some of your spells in addition to providing you with mana every turn.</Text>
	
    <!-- SETTLEMENTS -->
    <Text>Not only can your champions gain levels - so can your cities! Instead of experience, city levels are gained based on their population. There are five different levels, each with escalating benefits and unique buildings to construct.</Text>
    <Text>Specialization is important. Resources are linked to a given settlement, so a civic-minded leader will maximize output with special improvements.</Text>
    <Text>When your Sovereign or a Champion is within friendly territory, be sure to check the local shop to see what goods are available. A faction's shops will sell any equipment they have access to.  Keep an eye out for special equipment that would normally not be available to your people.</Text>
    <Text>While your Sovereign is able to found your first city, you will need to train Pioneers to found future settlements.</Text>
  	<Text>Keeping a champion stationed in a city lowers the city's Unrest by 5%.  Sovereigns and Champions with the Administrator trait lower it even further.</Text>
	
    <!-- UNITS -->
    <Text>Keep your troop roster updated as new technologies are learned and new equipment unlocked. Better armor, weapons and accessories will keep your forces from becoming dragon-fodder on the battlefield.</Text>
    <Text>You can specify your troop designs to automatically upgrade to the best weapon or armor available if you don't want to deal with making a new unit type every time you unlock equipment.</Text>
    <Text>Feeling lost? Check out the Hiergamenon in the top right corner of the main game screen for tutorials, tips and breakdowns of everything in the game.</Text>
  	<Text>Find yourself using the same spells and abilities in battle? You can hotkey abilities in tactical combat for easy access on each of your units. To do so click the hotkey icon next to them in the spell or ability list and select any slot on your hotbar.</Text>
	<Text>Splash damage hurts everyone around the victim, except the attacker.  It will damage the attackers allies so choose your targets carefully.</Text>
	<Text>If an enemy is particurly vulnerable or resistant to your attack you will see that displayed in the bottom right hand corner when you mouse over them.  Bringing a variety of attack types and using them against the appropriate enemies can be the difference between victory and defeat.</Text>
	<Text>The maul ability allows the monster to continue attacking its victim until it misses.  Be very careful around creatures that have it.</Text>
	<Text>Dark Wizards may look helpless with their low attack and defense, but they aren't.  Be sure to examine any special abilities a unit has before you attack.</Text>

    <!-- MAGIC -->
    <Text>Mana is the expendable source of magic for your faction. All your Champions and your Sovereign spend mana to cast their spells.</Text>
    <Text>When your Sovereign or Champions level up you can increase the spells they can cast by selecting traits in specific schools of magic.</Text>
    <Text>The fog that hangs over the world hides many secrets - none more desired than the Elemental Shards. By encompassing a crystal within your territorial control, shrines can be built to reap the magic within, resulting in a damage multiplier to some spells and increased mana generation for your Faction.</Text>
    <Text>Spells come in two major disciplines, each with their own benefits. Tactical spells, once mastered, can be used on the battlefield to boost your forces or destroy your foes. Strategic spells are designed to be cast on the main map, targeting settlements, armies, and even molding the landscape to your design. </Text>
    <Text>Some spells have mana maintenance costs, meaning they will require additional mana every turn to keep active. It's important to be mindful of these turn-by-turn costs in order to keep your most important spells active.</Text>
	<Text>Essence is the blue tile yield, it determines how many enchantments your city can have.  You can see how many enchantment slots a city has free on the banner that floats over the city on the world map.  If your city can support two enchantments and none are used there will be be 2 empty slots over the city's name.</Text>
    <Text>When you discover a technology you get a portion of that tech's research cost as 'Knowledge'.  Warfare techs provide Warfare Knowledge, Civilization techs provide Civilization Knowledge and Magic techs provide Magic Knowledge.  This Knowledge can be traded to and from other players and provides free research in the category it came from to the player who receives it.</Text>
